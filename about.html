<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born on the 32nd of April, -1111.
   I live in Narnia. I have new adventures everyday!</p>

<p>I attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  My favourite class is potions.
  It's a lot like chemistry! I learn new spells and have so much fun. Hogwarts is great! I love talking to
  all the portraits. I have a pet owl.</p>
  
<p>I like to ride pegasi. They are my best friends.
  I also love picking cake pops off of trees in The Magical Orchard, in my hometown.
  It is always a special treat to be there. I can't go there to much, because to much cake gives me a stomachache.
